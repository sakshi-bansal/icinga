The aim of this project is to implement a plugin for openbaton that the icinga monitoring solution.


Prerequisites:
1) Openbaton
2) Rabbitmq
3) Icinga server and API


Installation:
1) Download the project from:
     https://github.com/sakshi-bansal/icinga.git

2) Compile
     ./gradlew -build

3) Run the plugin
     java -jar build/libs/myplugin-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

4) To push the containers automatically run the script
     sh addHostToIcingaServer.sh

5) Visit the following icinga API sites to view the status of the services
     https://localhost:5665/v1/objects/hosts 
     https://localhost:5665/v1/objects/services


Functions Implemented:
These are the functions implemented by the plugin:

1) Create PM Job
     objectSelection - List of hosts for which performance metric is measured
     performanceMetrics - List of performance metrics 
     performanceMetricGroup - Null
     collectionPeriod - How frequent the performance information is collected
     reportingPeriod - 0

2) Delete PM Job
     pmJobIdsToDelete - Identifiers of performance jobs to be deleted

3) Query PM Job
     hostnames - List of hosts for which performance information is required
     metrics - List of performance metrics for which information is required 
     period - 0

4) Create Threshold
      objectSelector - List of hosts for which threshold should be created
      performanceMetrics - List of performance metrics 
      thresholdType - null
      thresholdDetails - Trigger severity, one/all triggers

5) Delete Threshold
      thresholdIds - Identifiers of thresholds to be deleted

6) Query Threshold
      queryFilter - Query the status of the thresholds (triggered/not triggered)

7) Subscribe For Fault
      AlarmEndPoint - Hostname, type, endpoint, severity

8) Unsubscribe For Fault
      AlarmEndPoint - Hostname, type, endpoint, severity

9) Get Alarm List
       perceivedSeverity - Get triggered alarms that match this severity level


Notification type
1) New alarm
     Generated when a threshold is crossed 

2) Alarm state change
     Generated when the state of an already triggered alarm is changed


Severity Mapping:
  WARNING  - Intermediate
  WARNING  - Warning
  UNKNOWN  - Minor
  CRITICAL - Major
  CRITICAL - Critical
